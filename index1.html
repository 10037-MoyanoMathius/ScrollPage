                    <h1>Fron-end</h1>
                    <p>Front-end development, also known as client-side development, is a crucial aspect of web development that focuses on creating the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of a website or web application. It involves implementing the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with directly in their web browsers.Front-end development refers to the process of building the user-facing part of a website or web application. It involves designing and implementing the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with in their web browsers. Front-end development focuses on the client-side of web development and is responsible for creating an engaging and user-friendly experience. Front-end developers need to ensure their websites are compatible with different web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. They should test and validate their code across various browsers to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.</p>

                    <h1>Back-end</h1>
                    <p>Back-end development, also known as server-side development, is a critical aspect of web development that focuses on building and maintaining the behind-the-scenes components of a website or web application. It involves the implementation and management of server-side logic, databases, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and other server-side technologies.Back-end development refers to the server-side of web development, focusing on the underlying logic, database management, and server configuration that powers the functionality of a website or web application. While front-end development handles the user interface and client-side interactions, back-end development is responsible for the server-side operations and data processing.  Back-end developers optimize the performance of web applications by improving database queries, caching frequently accessed data, optimizing server-side code, and minimizing resource usage. They also monitor server performance and handle scalability and load balancing to ensure the application can handle increased traffic and user load.</p>

            <h1>Javascript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a versatile and widely used programming language that empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. It is primarily known for its ability to enhance the functionality of websites by enabling client-side scripting.</p>
            <p>One of the fundamental strengths of JavaScript is its compatibility with all major web browsers, allowing developers to write code that works seamlessly across different platforms. This ubiquity has made JavaScript an essential language for web development, enabling the creation of engaging user experiences and responsive web pages.</p>

            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a set of tags and elements. HTML documents consist of a collection of these tags, which define the structure and semantics of the content.</p>

        <div class="container" id="css">
            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and visual styling of HTML documents. It provides a way to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a webpage. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying specific styles to them. CSS follows a cascading rule, meaning that styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden by more specific styles. CSS also uses specificity to determine which styles take precedence when multiple rules target the same element. Specificity is based on the combination of selectors used and can be modified using IDs, classes, and inline styles.</p>

            <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
            <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that simplifies the process of building responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. Developed by Twitter, Bootstrap provides a set of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and styles that can be easily incorporated into web projects. It aims to streamline the development process and ensure consistent design and functionality across different devices and browsers.Bootstrap provides a set of responsive utility classes that enable developers to show or hide content based on the device's screen size. These utility classes make it convenient to build responsive designs without the need for writing custom CSS.</p>

        <div class="container" id="github">
            <h1>GitHub</h1>
            <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for version control repositories, facilitating collaborative software development. It serves as a central hub for managing and sharing code, allowing individuals and teams to work together on projects efficiently.GitHub allows users to create public or private repositories to store and manage their code. Public repositories are accessible to the public, facilitating open-source collaboration, while private repositories offer more restricted access for proprietary or sensitive projects.</p>
